      <h2>HELLO! HELLO! HELLO!</h2>
      <h2>this guide is a sort of '''turn by turn directions''' where we go point-to-point (P2P) over METAHEAP. with the foundation as it stands; it relies heavily on first-only-instances and going really fast.</h2>
      <h2>in order to pull off this: maneuver ... we need cat like performance (POKE/OUCH) --> at the scale of gaming (PING/PONG) // with the physics of speed on our side.</h2>
      <h2>by ditching encryption, leaving everything as plain text, and using layers when needed \\ HT's foundation scales up while it's database commands grow stronger.</h2>
<pre><code class="language-md">BEEP --> PING ... POKE
HONK <-- PONG ... OUCH
</code></pre>
      <h2>between each layer exists standard BIND & BOND protocols; this is like saying, "there exists spaces between words" which is true but we choose not to endlessly drill down into every topic because destination is key here.</h2>
      <h2>to begin, we use JavaScript as a language that can be run from the browser. press developer tools (option + command + i) then open the console tab. in this box: any line of JS code can be executed at the bottom beside the '>' symbol. to follow along just copy/paste code from the examples then hit enter for results; how NICE is that? sIENCe when broken down is just simple <a href="https://dimension.click">question <--> answer</a> communication at the end of the day.</h2>
      <h2>to start, the BEEP/HONK method is good for sending health checks between each layer. when called, BEEP checks the database using PING <--> PONG commands and then responds back HONK if there is a successful connection:</h2>
<pre><code class="language-js">let road = "Main Street"
let vehicle = ht.mobile()
let transport = ht.lane(vehicle, road)
let hear = ht.listen(transport)
let noise = ht.beep(transport)
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-js">// mobile: enter...
// lane: transporting...
// lane: yield on SFM...
// listen: Main Street
// beep: HONK
</code></pre>
      <h2>there is a reoccuring pattern with the structure of HT. the naming of things are totally based off of a situation by situation bases. so, in order to see (PASS & ACK) between each layer of the system ENCODE then DECODE methods must be used. that is like saying: the layers BIND, BEEP, NICE, PING, and POKE all function differently yet communicate with one another over standard protocols (BNP).</h2>
